  Some resources are from unethical sources. (pirate sites, cracked software,
  etc) Everything here will have a legitimate source, as well as a "alternative"
  source for you to explore at your own discretion.

We began at the tower: a hand-soldered board with a firmware patch that had been applied in the field with a shaky laptop battery. The SHA in the patch notes didn't match the binary on disk. The watchdog timer had been widened to 80ms to "solve" an unrelated issue.

<Sidebar title="Field Fix Checklist">
  - Photograph the board before touching it. - Dump flash twice with different
  tools. - Extract build ID strings from UART logs. - Reproduce conditions with
  a noise generator before shipping hardware.
</Sidebar>

We reproduced the "storm" by saturating the RF front end with a function generator while throttling the backhaul. The mesh stack resorted to an undocumented "chirp" beacon, only present in pre-release firmware. That beacon collided with a watchdog extension and created the ghost.

We reset the timer, stripped the chirp, and shipped a new build. The rain rolled back in and the logs stayed quiet.
