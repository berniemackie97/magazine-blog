We carried too many UART logs on thumb drives. Livewire Probe lets us stream them through a side-band HTTP channel with a single flag.

<Sidebar title="Install">
- Drop `livewire-probe.uf2` on the device.
- Set `PROBE_CHUNK=8k` in env.
- Run `probe relay --port COM6 --to https://relay.local/hooks`.
</Sidebar>

The probe buffers logs in ring buffers, strips ANSI, and batches in JSON for quick ingestion. It also stamps the build ID so we can tie logs to binaries.
