We needed radio line-of-sight to land a firmware update to a far cabin. The quickest tower was the ridge itself. We packed a pelican case with a low-power dev server, a folding mast, and instant ramen.

At midnight the mesh lit up. We turned the pelican into a wind break, pointed a Yagi, and pushed a 12MB image over a link that barely held. The cabin node rebooted with clean logs.
